### If we do a survey of the heights of people in a population, we may get a distribution like this: This histogram indicates how likely it is for anyone in the survey to be in a particular height range. (6 ft is around 183 cm)

```
 There are at least 10 elements in the frequency vector, f. 

If another sample was taken under the same conditions, the frequencies should be broadly similar.

No one in the world is less than 160 cm tall. 
```

### One of the tasks of machine learning is to fit a model to data in order to represent the underlying distribution. For the heights of a population, a model we may use to predict frequencies is the Normal (or Gaussian) distribution. This is a model for a bell-shaped curve, which looks like this,

###  A better fit would have as much overlap as it can, reducing the residuals as much as possible. How could the model be improved to give the best fit to the data?

``` 
Keep the standard deviation, σ, approximately the same.
Decrease the mean, μ.
```

### # Replace μ and σ with values that minimise the SSR.
```
 p = [160, 6]
  ```

### The goal in machine learning is to find the parameter set where the model fits the data as well as it possibly can. This translates into finding the lowest point, the global minimum, in this space. Select all true statements below.
 
```
Each point on the surface represents a set of parameters 
p=[μσ]
Moving at right angles to contour lines in the parameter space will have the greatest effect on the fit than moving in other directions.
```

###  Δp will give the best improvement in the model?
