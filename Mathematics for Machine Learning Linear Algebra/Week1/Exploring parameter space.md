### If we do a survey of the heights of people in a population, we may get a distribution like this: This histogram indicates how likely it is for anyone in the survey to be in a particular height range. (6 ft is around 183 cm)

```
 There are at least 10 elements in the frequency vector, f. 

If another sample was taken under the same conditions, the frequencies should be broadly similar.

No one in the world is less than 160 cm tall. 
```

### One of the tasks of machine learning is to fit a model to data in order to represent the underlying distribution. For the heights of a population, a model we may use to predict frequencies is the Normal (or Gaussian) distribution. This is a model for a bell-shaped curve, which looks like this,


```
p=[ 155 
    12 ]
